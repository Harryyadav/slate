# Writing Documentation

The content for our API docs are all located in the `source/includes` folder of
this repo. You will likely create a new markdown file here, or extend an
existing on to write your documentation.

Be sure to update `changelog.md` also located in that folder whenever you make
changes to the API documentation. Every substantial change to our API should
include a change to this file.

All MRs should have a milestone set: this indicates what version of SDE this
API change is targeting.
